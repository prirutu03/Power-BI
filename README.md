Project Description: Call Centre Data Analysis using Power BI

As part of a comprehensive data analysis project, I successfully leveraged Power BI to provide valuable insights into call center operations. 
The visualization focused on key performance metrics, enhancing strategic decision-making and optimizing customer support processes. The project encompassed the following:

Calls Overview:
Visualized calls answered, total calls, and resolved issues, providing a holistic view of call center activity.

Customer Satisfaction:
Visualized customer satisfaction rating, highlighting overall satisfaction rating out of 5.

Topic-wise Call Analysis:
Created insightful visualizations showcasing the distribution of calls across various topics, enabling targeted issue resolution strategies.

Call Efficiency Metrics:
Calculated and visualized overall calls answered in percentage, average calls answered speed, and other efficiency metrics for continuous improvement.

Agent Performance Analysis:
Designed an agent performance table with key metrics, including the count of calls handled by each agent, contributing to a data-driven approach for performance evaluation.

Filtering Capabilities:
Implemented dynamic filters for agents, allowing users to drill down into individual performance, as well as filters for month and day-wise analysis.
 
The visualizations enhanced the understanding of call patterns, agent performance, and overall customer satisfaction, contributing to the optimization of call center strategies.
